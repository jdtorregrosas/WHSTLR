# WHSTLR
### (What happened since the last release?)

**********************************

When some people is working on the same project in the same repository, in different features, can be difficult to have the enough comunication in order to tell all the included features in the release. All this information is better to have documented in your release notes. But how can you write everything that all the team did?. Where write all the team everything that makes? Normally in your commit comments, you write your changes. The main idea od WHSTLR is to make easier your release notes writing. To write a good list of features with just a little of your effort. So that you can read them, they must be in a good format, saved in your system and give good information.
